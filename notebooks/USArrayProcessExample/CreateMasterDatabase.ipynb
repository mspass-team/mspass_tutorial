    "# Download Master Metadata\n",
    "This notebook creates a master database with all source and receiver metadata loaded in the standard MsPASS collection called \"source\", \"channel\", and \"site\".   The collections are large as they span the entire time range of operation of the TA in the lower 48 states.   To reduce the memory footprint, yearly processing scripts should subset these collections to only those spanning the data time range using the query argument of the normalization matcher classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier version of the usarray workflow downloaded year blocks of source and receiver metadata.  I realized, however, that that created a mess at the end of preprocessing when we needed to merge all yearly databases to a single master for input to pwmig or related processing of the full data set.  With this model the final merge uses year databases as input with all outputs to the master that is the database created by this notebook.  "

    "This procedure will download way more sources than what was used in the original download but that is preferable to dropping a lot of data.  There are two complications:\n",
    "1.  The large size of usarray requires a large range for the core shadow edge.   The alternative would be the more complicated procedure used in the original download where we used a center point.   That is worse, however, as it drops stations that ran continuously during the entire array operation.\n",
    "2.  I drop the magnitude threshold here from the original download size which drastically increases the source collection size.   Hopefully there will be few if any overlaps and those that are can be resolved."
