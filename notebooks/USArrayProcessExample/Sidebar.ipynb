    "Something I have found universally useful in working with large data sets like this is to create a scatch notebook like this one.  The purpose is to run one up validations while working on the full data set.   I include this notebook in this mspass_tutorial directory to illustrate the use, but anyone reading this should recognize a notebook like this should be treated as a scratch workspace that connects to MongoDB and allows you to explore the state of your data.  \n",
