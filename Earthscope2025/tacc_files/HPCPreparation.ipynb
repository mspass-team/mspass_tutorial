    "# HPC exercise preparation\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Session 2 of the class will involve work her on GeoLab and on the HPC machine at the Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC) called frontera.   This notebook has no python code but contains instructions needed for that exercise.  Instructions that can executed somewhere else by a cut-and-paste operation are in \"raw\" boxes.  If they require substitutions the required substitutions will be highlighted in italics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "You will want to have two windows running to do this exercise effectively.   \n",
    "1.  Here on GeoLab launch a new \"Terminal\" tab from the Launcher tab.  I will refer to this window in this document as **Terminal A**.\n",
    "2.  On your local compouter launch the \"Terminal\" application for your platform.   For Macs and Linux machines that is the name of the application.  For windows you may need a special application like putty capable of terminal interaction with a remote host that supports ssh.   I fill refer to this window in this document as **Terminal B**. "

The default jupyter text editor has not global search-replace function, but that is essentially what you need here.  In this entire file you need to change all occurrences of \"/scratch1/04465/pavlis/ES2025\" to the output of the pwd command in **Terminal B** you created a few minutes ago - i.e.  your top level directory in scratch.  \n",
