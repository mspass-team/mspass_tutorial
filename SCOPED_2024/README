The notebooks in this directory were used for the SCOPED workshop held 
May 20-24 in Seattle, Washington.   For simplcitity students in the workshop 
should clone this repository and run the tutorials from this working directory.  

The notebook called "data_retrieval_mspass2024course.ipynb" can be used 
if you want to run this tutorial outside the workshop.   It retrieves and saves
the waveform data used in the workshop.   The data set is too large for github 
and is best handled by regeneration.   Be warned that at the time of this workshop
that process is pretty slow and takes of the order of 2 hours.   That notebook 
is expected to actually be archaic soon as Earthscope moves their data to 
a cloud service provider.
